# Phase 2

In this segment I will focus on hardware and software keeping 3D printing and software development in general.

PS: I am familiar with basic hardware and software tools, if you are not do check out youtube videos and purchase kits and tools if required.

Days can vary by Â±2 

If any additional material, code is required it will be updated in this directory only.
