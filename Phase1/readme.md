# Phase 1

In this segment I will focus on electronics with keeping PCB designing in mind for future.

PS: I am familiar with basic electronic tools, if you are not do check out youtube videos and purchase kits and tools.

Days can vary by Â±2 

If any additional material, code is required it will be updated in this directory only.
